Geospatial Data Inventory and Landscape Assessment for the A2A World Planetary Data Nexus
1. Introduction
The A2A World Planetary Data Nexus initiative aims to construct a comprehensive, integrated digital representation of Earth, leveraging diverse geospatial datasets to model complex planetary systems and processes. The success of this ambitious undertaking hinges on the availability, accessibility, and suitability of foundational geospatial data streams. This report provides an inventory and assessment of key publicly accessible geospatial datasets relevant to the A2A World concept.
The objective is to identify, characterize, and evaluate at least 25 specific datasets across critical domains, including satellite-based Earth observation, terrain and elevation, geology, archaeology, ocean floor bathymetry, atmospheric and climate conditions, geophysical fields (magnetic and gravity), land cover, human population, and vector basemaps. For each dataset, this report details the source/provider, data type, spatial and temporal coverage, resolution, public access mechanisms, and licensing information.
Following the detailed inventory, the report evaluates the overall geospatial data landscape concerning its fitness for constructing the A2A World Planetary Data Nexus. This evaluation considers data availability, accessibility trends, the complexities of licensing, and identifies significant gaps and challenges that must be addressed for successful data integration and utilization within the Nexus framework. The findings presented aim to inform the data acquisition strategy and technical architecture design for the A2A World project.
2. Earth Observation: Satellite Imagery
Satellite imagery forms a cornerstone for understanding Earth's surface dynamics, monitoring environmental change, and mapping land cover across various spatial and temporal scales. Both optical (measuring reflected sunlight) and radar (measuring backscattered microwave pulses) sensors provide critical, complementary perspectives. Recent advancements emphasize the provision of Analysis-Ready Data (ARD) and cloud-optimized formats, significantly streamlining large-scale analysis workflows.
2.1 High-Resolution Optical Imagery
Optical imagery provides detailed information on surface features, vegetation health, water bodies, and land use, akin to human vision but across multiple spectral bands.
Sentinel-2 (ESA/Copernicus):


Dataset: Sentinel-2 Level-2A (L2A) provides Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) corrected surface reflectance, representing the 'true' surface color after atmospheric interference removal.
Source/Provider: European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the European Union's Copernicus Programme.
Data Type: Multispectral Optical Imagery.
Coverage/Resolution: The mission offers global coverage of land surfaces (excluding the poles). It features high spatial resolution with four bands at 10 meters (Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared), six bands at 20 meters (including Red Edge and Short-Wave Infrared bands crucial for vegetation analysis), and three bands at 60 meters (primarily for atmospheric correction).1 The twin satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) provide a high revisit frequency, imaging the equator every 5 days and mid-latitudes even more frequently.1
Access: Data is primarily accessed via the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, which serves as the central hub offering discovery, visualization, and download capabilities through tools like the Copernicus Browser.2 Data is also available through various cloud platforms (e.g., Amazon Web Services Open Data, Google Earth Engine) and partner hubs.2 Accessing data directly from cloud providers might incur costs for storage or processing, although the Landsat data itself remains free.7 Data is typically provided in the native SAFE format, but increasingly available as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) for efficient cloud-based access.2
Licensing: Sentinel data adheres to the Copernicus policy of free, full, and open access.1 Users are required to provide attribution (e.g., "Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data [Year]") and indicate if modifications were made.2 The license is often described as compatible with Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO 2 or generally covered by the overarching Copernicus data policy.5 There are no licensing fees or restrictions on commercial or non-commercial usage.1
Relevance: Sentinel-2 provides state-of-the-art, high-resolution, frequently updated global optical data. It is invaluable for applications such as detailed land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring (crop type, health), forest management, water body delineation, disaster mapping, and change detection.1
Landsat 8/9 Collection 2 (USGS/NASA):


Dataset: Landsat 8/9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) / Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) Collection 2 Level-2 Science Products (L2SP). These include atmospherically corrected Surface Reflectance (SR) and Surface Temperature (ST) data.
Source/Provider: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Data Type: Multispectral Optical Imagery.
Coverage/Resolution: Provides global coverage of land surfaces. Spatial resolution is 30 meters for multispectral bands, 15 meters for the panchromatic band, and 100 meters for thermal bands (delivered resampled to 30 meters). The combined constellation of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 offers an 8-day revisit cycle globally.7
Access: Primary access is through the USGS EarthExplorer portal.7 Other tools include LandsatLook for visualization and quick access 8, and GloVis.8 Data is also widely available on major cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Earth Engine (GEE).7 Accessing data directly from cloud providers might incur costs for storage or processing, although the Landsat data itself remains free.7 Data is typically provided in GeoTIFF format, often as individual bands or scene bundles.7
Licensing: Landsat data distributed by the USGS is in the U.S. Public Domain.7 There are no restrictions on its use, modification, or redistribution for commercial or non-commercial purposes. The USGS requests citation as a data source when the data is used.7
Relevance: The Landsat program provides the longest continuous global record of Earth's surface from space, dating back to 1972.7 Collection 2 represents significant improvements in geometric accuracy and radiometric calibration over previous collections, making it highly suitable for time-series analysis, historical land use/land cover change studies, and long-term environmental monitoring. The public domain status greatly simplifies its integration and use.
2.2 Radar Imagery
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers unique capabilities, penetrating clouds and imaging day or night, making it essential for monitoring in persistently cloudy regions and for applications sensitive to surface structure and moisture.
Sentinel-1 (ESA/Copernicus):
Dataset: Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD). These products are focused, multi-looked, and projected to ground range using an Earth ellipsoid model.9
Source/Provider: ESA / Copernicus Programme.
Data Type: C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery. Available in different polarizations (e.g., VV, VH).
Coverage/Resolution: Offers global coverage with high revisit frequency (potentially every 6-12 days, depending on location and acquisition plan).1 Spatial resolution varies with acquisition mode; the primary Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode typically provides 5m x 20m resolution over a 250 km swath, while the Extra Wide Swath (EW) mode offers coarser resolution (e.g., 25m x 100m) over a wider 400 km swath.9
Access: Accessible via the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem 9, Copernicus Browser, and cloud platforms (AWS, GEE). Data is typically delivered in the SAFE format, but increasingly processed into COGs for easier analysis.9
Licensing: Follows the standard Copernicus free and open data policy, requiring attribution.4
Relevance: Sentinel-1's all-weather, day/night capability is crucial for reliable monitoring, especially in tropical regions or during emergency response situations (e.g., floods, earthquakes).1 It is highly sensitive to surface structure, moisture, and dielectric properties, making it valuable for applications like flood mapping, soil moisture estimation, deforestation monitoring (especially under clouds), maritime surveillance (ship detection, oil spills), sea ice monitoring, and measuring ground deformation (interferometry).1 It provides a vital complement to optical sensors like Sentinel-2 and Landsat.
Implications for A2A World
The landscape for core satellite imagery is remarkably favorable for an initiative like the A2A World Planetary Data Nexus. The dominance of open data policies from the Copernicus (Sentinel) and USGS/NASA (Landsat) programs represents a paradigm shift from previous reliance on costly commercial data.1 This significantly lowers the barrier for large-scale data acquisition, enabling broad scientific and potentially commercial applications within the Nexus without prohibitive licensing costs for these fundamental datasets. While Landsat data resides in the public domain, requiring no specific license, Copernicus data mandates attribution, a requirement that needs careful management within Nexus data provenance and distribution workflows.2
Furthermore, the clear trend towards providing data in cloud-optimized formats (e.g., COG, Zarr) and as analysis-ready science products (e.g., Level-2 surface reflectance) drastically reduces the preprocessing burden on users.2 This facilitates large-scale, cloud-based analytics directly within the Nexus environment, diminishing the need for extensive local download and processing infrastructure and allowing leveraging the scalability of cloud platforms.7
Finally, the inherent complementarity between optical (Sentinel-2, Landsat) and radar (Sentinel-1) sensors is critical. Optical sensors provide detailed spectral information under clear conditions, while radar penetrates clouds and offers sensitivity to structure and moisture.1 Integrating both data streams within the Nexus is essential for robust, comprehensive environmental monitoring, overcoming the limitations of each sensor type (e.g., cloud cover obscuring optical views, interpretation challenges with radar backscatter) and enabling a more complete understanding of surface processes.
3. Terrain and Elevation Data
Terrain and elevation data, encompassing both raw point clouds and derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), are fundamental geospatial layers. They underpin the understanding of topography, geomorphology, hydrology, and provide essential context for orthorectifying imagery and analyzing landscape processes. A key distinction exists between high-resolution datasets, often derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and global models offering broader coverage at lower resolutions.
3.1 LiDAR Point Clouds
LiDAR technology directly measures the three-dimensional structure of the surface, providing detailed raw elevation measurements.
USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) Lidar Point Cloud (LPC):
Dataset: 3DEP Lidar Point Cloud (LPC) collection, comprising raw point cloud data from various acquisition projects.
Source/Provider: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Data Type: LiDAR Point Cloud data, typically classified (e.g., ground, vegetation, buildings).
Coverage/Resolution: Coverage focuses on the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and US territories, with ongoing expansion efforts.14 The resolution, defined by point density and accuracy, varies significantly between projects and is categorized by USGS Quality Levels (QLs).13 Data is delivered in the LAZ format, a lossless compressed version of the standard LAS format.15
Access: Data can be downloaded via the USGS The National Map Data Delivery platform 13, direct download links 15, and is also available as an AWS Public Dataset for cloud-based access and processing.13
Licensing: As a product of the US government, 3DEP data, including the LPC, is in the U.S. Public Domain. It is available free of charge and without restrictions on use.13
Relevance: LPC data represents the highest resolution, foundational elevation data available through 3DEP. It captures the detailed 3D structure of both the bare earth terrain and surface features like vegetation canopies and buildings, enabling the creation of high-fidelity DEMs, Digital Surface Models (DSMs), and specialized analyses (e.g., forestry, urban modeling, detailed geomorphology).
3.2 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
DEMs are raster grids representing surface elevation, typically the bare earth, derived from sources like LiDAR, photogrammetry, or radar interferometry.
USGS 3DEP DEMs:


Dataset: 3DEP Standard DEM products, derived from the best available source data (often 3DEP LPC). Includes resolutions such as 1 meter, 1/3 arc-second (~10 meters), 1 arc-second (~30 meters), and 2 arc-seconds (~60 meters).
Source/Provider: USGS.
Data Type: Raster Digital Elevation Model, representing the topographic bare-earth surface.14
Coverage/Resolution: Primarily covers the United States, with resolution availability dependent on the underlying source data.14 The 1-meter DEM is available where high-resolution LiDAR has been acquired. The 1/3 arc-second DEM provides broader coverage across the conterminous US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and other islands.14 Coarser resolutions (1, 2 arc-sec) offer near-complete US coverage.14
Access: Available through USGS The National Map Data Delivery, specialized viewers like the 3DEP Dynamic Elevation Viewer (offering derived products like hillshade, slope, aspect), and web map services (WMS, WCS).13 Data is typically provided in GeoTIFF format.14
Licensing: U.S. Public Domain. Available free of charge without use restrictions.13
Relevance: These DEMs provide readily usable, authoritative bare-earth elevation surfaces for the US at various resolutions. They are essential inputs for countless geospatial applications, including hydrological modeling, terrain analysis, orthorectification, visualization, and infrastructure planning.
ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) v3:


Dataset: Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model Version 3 (ASTGTM v3).
Source/Provider: Developed jointly by NASA (USA) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI, Japan). Processed by the Sensor Information Laboratory Corporation (SILC).17
Data Type: Raster Digital Elevation Model.
Coverage/Resolution: Provides near-global coverage of land areas, extending from 83° North to 83° South latitude.17 The spatial resolution is 1 arc-second, approximately 30 meters at the equator.17
Access: Data is distributed through NASA's Earthdata Search portal and the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) Data Pool.17 Available formats include standard GeoTIFF, Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG), and NetCDF4.17
Licensing: The data is provided "as is," and users are explicitly warned about known inaccuracies and artifacts.17 While a specific license isn't stated in the snippets, NASA-distributed data is typically in the public domain or available under open licenses for research and educational use. However, the disclaimer regarding responsibility for damages suggests users should exercise caution.17 Access is free.
Relevance: ASTER GDEM offers a globally consistent DEM at approximately 30-meter resolution, derived from stereo-correlation of ASTER optical imagery.18 It serves as a valuable baseline elevation dataset, particularly in regions lacking higher-resolution public data. However, its quality can be variable, with known issues like artifacts and voids, necessitating careful assessment before use, especially compared to radar-derived DEMs or high-quality national datasets.17
Implications for A2A World
A significant disparity exists between the high-resolution terrain data available for the United States and the data available globally. The USGS 3DEP program provides extensive, high-quality, public domain LiDAR point clouds and derived DEMs (down to 1-meter resolution) covering large portions of the US.13 This level of detail and open access is currently unmatched on a global scale. For regions outside the US, the A2A World Nexus will primarily rely on global DEMs like ASTER GDEM v3 (~30m) 17 or potentially other global models like the Copernicus DEM (GLO-30/GLO-90, not detailed in snippets but relevant) or GEBCO for bathymetry.20 This inherent resolution and potential accuracy difference between US and non-US terrain data must be carefully considered and accounted for in any global-scale analyses performed within the Nexus. Sourcing and integrating higher-resolution regional or national datasets from other countries represents a significant, but potentially valuable, challenge.
Furthermore, the variability in source data, processing methods, and resulting accuracy across different DEM and LiDAR datasets underscores the critical importance of robust metadata management and quality awareness.13 Users of the A2A World Nexus must be able to assess the fitness-for-use of a given elevation dataset based on its documented characteristics (e.g., 3DEP Quality Levels, ASTER known issues) rather than relying solely on nominal resolution, which can be misleading.13 Incorporating tools or guidance for quality assessment within the Nexus will be crucial for ensuring appropriate application of these foundational datasets.
4. Geological Data
Geological maps and associated data provide fundamental insights into Earth's subsurface structure, composition, resource potential, geohazards, and evolutionary history. Unlike standardized global satellite monitoring programs, geological mapping is traditionally a national endeavor, leading to heterogeneity in data standards, availability, and access policies.
4.1 Global/Regional Aggregators
Portals aim to improve discovery and access across national boundaries, though they typically do not host the data themselves.
OneGeology:
Dataset: Acts as a portal providing access to geological map data and related geoscience information held by participating national geological surveys and other organizations worldwide.21 The specific datasets accessible vary depending on the contributions of these providers.
Source/Provider: Data originates from various national geological survey organizations (e.g., British Geological Survey, USGS, BRGM France). The portal and initiative are managed by OneGeology.21
Data Type: Primarily geological maps (often served as web services like WMS/WFS), but may include related geoscience data depending on the provider.
Coverage/Resolution: Aims for global coverage, but the actual extent, map scales, and data detail are entirely dependent on what individual participating organizations contribute and make available through the portal.22
Access: Access is facilitated through the OneGeology Portal.21 Users typically discover data via the portal and are then directed to the provider's web services or data download pages. Registration is required for data providers wishing to contribute.21 Note: At the time of review, the data coordination form for providers was suspended, potentially impacting new data registration.22
Licensing: There is no single OneGeology license. Data usage terms and licensing conditions are determined by the individual data providers (the originating geological surveys).22 Users must consult the specific license associated with each dataset they access via the portal. The portal itself has a privacy policy regarding user information.23
Relevance: OneGeology serves as a crucial international initiative and starting point for discovering and accessing geological map data from diverse global sources. It helps overcome fragmentation by providing a unified search interface, although accessing and using the data still requires navigating provider-specific terms.
4.2 National Databases (Example: US)
National databases often provide the most comprehensive and authoritative geological information for their respective territories.
USGS National Geologic Map Database (NGMDB):
Dataset: A comprehensive national archive of geologic maps, stratigraphic information (Geolex), geologic mapping standards, and related geoscience reports and data for the United States.24
Source/Provider: Primarily the USGS, but also includes significant contributions from State Geological Surveys and other collaborating organizations, mandated by the Geologic Mapping Act.24
Data Type: Includes geologic maps in various digital and scanned formats, accompanying reports, paleontological data, geochronological data, geochemical data, and geophysical data.24
Coverage/Resolution: Coverage is focused on the United States. The database contains over 100,000 maps and reports ranging from the early 1800s to the present, with widely varying scales and resolutions depending on the specific map or dataset.24
Access: The primary access point is the searchable online Geoscience Map Catalog.24 A visual interface, mapView, provides interactive access to selected maps.24 Data is often available as downloadable files linked from the catalog records.24 The NGMDB website provides overall access.25
Licensing: As a Congressionally-mandated national archive primarily managed by the USGS, the data contributed by USGS is implicitly intended for public access and likely falls under U.S. Public Domain rules.24 However, data contributed by state surveys or other organizations may carry their own specific usage terms, although the overarching goal is public accessibility.24
Relevance: The NGMDB serves as the authoritative and most comprehensive repository for geological map information within the United States, essential for any detailed geological study or resource assessment in the region.
Implications for A2A World
Integrating geological data into the A2A World Nexus presents distinct challenges compared to more standardized global datasets like satellite imagery or bathymetry. Geological data access and licensing are highly fragmented, reflecting the primarily national focus of geological mapping efforts.22 While global portals like OneGeology significantly aid in the discovery process by aggregating metadata from numerous providers 21, the actual data access, formats, standards, and crucially, the licensing terms, remain dependent on the originating national or regional geological survey.22 This contrasts sharply with the centralized distribution and standardized (though sometimes subtly different) open licenses of programs like Copernicus Sentinel or USGS Landsat.5 Consequently, building a globally consistent geological layer within the Nexus will necessitate considerable effort in identifying, acquiring, and managing heterogeneous datasets from a multitude of sources, each potentially with unique and possibly restrictive usage conditions. Data harmonization across different standards, scales, and terminologies will be a significant technical hurdle.
The national focus of primary geological data collection means that while databases like the USGS NGMDB offer rich, detailed information for specific countries 24, achieving comparable global coverage is problematic. There is no global equivalent to a Landsat or Sentinel program systematically mapping the Earth's geology at a consistent high resolution. Therefore, the A2A World Nexus will likely have to assemble its global geological understanding by piecing together data of varying quality, scale, vintage, and semantic consistency from numerous national sources accessed via portals like OneGeology or directly. This process will inevitably encounter significant spatial gaps and inconsistencies, requiring careful documentation and potentially the use of lower-resolution global syntheses where detailed data is unavailable.
5. Archaeological Site Data
Archaeological data, encompassing information about past human activities and settlements, is crucial for understanding long-term human-environment interactions and cultural landscapes. However, this data type presents unique challenges related to data sensitivity, varying recording standards, preservation concerns, and consequently, often restricted access and heterogeneous licensing conditions. Sources range from detailed excavation reports to national site inventories and community-curated portals.
5.1 Excavation Databases
These databases focus on compiling information from specific archaeological fieldwork projects.
Fasti Online:
Dataset: An online database focusing on archaeological excavations conducted since the year 2000.26
Source/Provider: A project of the International Association of Classical Archaeology (AIAC) and the Center for the Study of Ancient Italy at the University of Texas at Austin (CSAI).26
Data Type: Contains excavation reports, site summaries, site location information, dates, monument types, and director information.26 Includes over 12,000 records.26
Coverage/Resolution: Geographically focused on the Classical World, primarily the Mediterranean region.26 Temporal scope is excavations post-2000.26
Access: Accessible via a searchable online database interface with keyword and map-based search capabilities.26
Licensing: Unless otherwise specified, data is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license, promoting open access and reuse with attribution and share-alike conditions.26
Relevance: Provides valuable, structured access to recent archaeological excavation data for a significant historical region under a relatively open license, making it potentially suitable for integration.
5.2 Site Portals/Inventories
These platforms aggregate information about archaeological sites, often from diverse sources including official records and community contributions.
The Megalithic Portal:


Dataset: A large, community-driven database listing over 50,000 prehistoric and other ancient sites globally, with a strong focus on megalithic monuments.29
Source/Provider: Operated by megalithic.co.uk, relies heavily on user contributions.
Data Type: Includes site locations (coordinates), descriptions, photographs, condition reports, and visitor logs contributed by users.29
Coverage/Resolution: Global scope, though coverage density likely varies, with strengths in Europe.29 Location precision may vary.
Access: Information is browsable and searchable via the website.30 A key feature is a KML file download containing site locations for use in Google Earth.29
Licensing: The website content is copyrighted. The KML download containing site locations has highly restrictive terms: it is explicitly stated to be for personal use only and not for use outside of Google Earth without permission. Furthermore, no warranty is given regarding data accuracy.29 General terms of use also highlight the need to seek landowner permission before visiting sites and remind users of legal protections for monuments.30
Relevance: A rich source of information, particularly for European prehistory and megalithic sites, compiled by an enthusiastic community. However, the restrictive license on the downloadable location data severely limits its utility for systematic integration into a platform like the A2A World Nexus.
Open Context:


Dataset: Publishes a wide variety of archaeological and related research data contributed by individual researchers and projects.31
Source/Provider: Operated by the Alexandria Archive Institute, a non-profit organization. Data contributed by the research community.31
Data Type: Highly varied, including structured data tables (artifact inventories, faunal analyses), field notes, diaries, images, maps, geospatial data, and vocabularies.31 Includes aggregated North American site file records via the DINAA partnership.32
Coverage/Resolution: Dependent on the contributed projects; potentially global but coverage is project-based.
Access: Data is accessible via the Open Context online platform, featuring faceted search, map visualizations, image browsing, and importantly, download options for structured data (e.g., CSV format) and APIs for programmatic access.31
Licensing: All content published through Open Context carries explicit Creative Commons licenses (e.g., CC BY, CC0), clearly granting permission for reuse and adaptation with appropriate attribution.31 Access to view and download data appears free, although data contributors may incur publishing fees based on project size.31 Open Context emphasizes Linked Open Data principles, assigning unique identifiers (URIs/DOIs) to facilitate citation and interoperability.31
Relevance: Open Context represents a leading model for publishing open, citable, and reusable archaeological data. Its commitment to open licensing and structured data formats makes it a prime candidate for sourcing archaeological information suitable for integration into the A2A World Nexus, overcoming many typical access and licensing barriers in this domain.
Implications for A2A World
The landscape of digital archaeological data is characterized by extreme variability in accessibility and licensing. Sources range from openly licensed databases like Fasti Online (CC BY-SA) 26 and, notably, Open Context (various CC licenses) 32, to platforms with highly restrictive terms for data reuse, such as the KML download from The Megalithic Portal (personal use only).29 This heterogeneity reflects diverse institutional policies, concerns over data sensitivity, varying funding models (e.g., Open Context's publishing fees 31), and the historical lack of standardized open data practices in the discipline. Consequently, integrating archaeological data into the A2A World Nexus requires careful vetting of potential sources, prioritizing those with clear open licenses like Open Context and Fasti Online. A substantial amount of valuable archaeological data likely resides in national or regional inventories with limited public access or unclear usage rights, posing a significant challenge for comprehensive global integration.
Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity of archaeological site locations necessitates careful consideration. Precise coordinates are often restricted to prevent looting, vandalism, or other damage to cultural heritage resources.30 While not always explicitly stated as a restriction in the reviewed sources, this is a pervasive issue in archaeology. Platforms like Open Context likely employ editorial oversight 31 and data use agreements that may address sensitivity concerns. The A2A World Nexus must therefore be designed with mechanisms to handle potentially sensitive location data responsibly. This could involve implementing access controls, utilizing generalized location information (e.g., administrative regions) instead of precise coordinates where necessary, or focusing on aggregated analyses rather than individual site points, ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines and legal protections for cultural heritage. Simply aggregating all discoverable point locations without considering sensitivity would be irresponsible and potentially illegal.
6. Ocean Floor and Bathymetry Data
Mapping the depth and shape of the ocean floor (bathymetry) is essential for numerous applications, including physical oceanography, marine geology, resource management, navigation safety, telecommunications cable routing, and modeling hazards such as tsunamis and storm surges. Data sources range from global compilations, providing complete coverage at moderate resolutions, to high-resolution surveys focused on coastal areas or specific regions of interest.
6.1 Global Grids
These datasets aim to provide a seamless representation of seafloor topography across all oceans.
GEBCO Gridded Bathymetry Data:
Dataset: The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Grid. The latest version identified is the GEBCO_2024 Grid.20
Source/Provider: An international collaborative project (GEBCO) operating under the joint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO. Data contributions come from numerous international sources and surveys, including the Seabed 2030 project.20

Access: Data can be downloaded from the GEBCO website portal.20 Options include downloading global files (NetCDF) or tiles (NetCDF, Esri ASCII raster, GeoTiff).20 A dedicated application allows downloading data for user-defined areas.20 Web Map Services (WMS) are also available for visualization.33
Licensing: The GEBCO Grid is explicitly placed in the Public Domain and may be used free of charge for any purpose.20 Users are expected to accept the conditions of use and disclaimer information upon using the data.20
Relevance: GEBCO is widely recognized as the authoritative, standard global bathymetric dataset. Its public domain status and comprehensive coverage make it an essential foundational layer for any large-scale oceanographic, geophysical, or Earth system modeling within the A2A World Nexus.
6.2 Coastal and Regional Models
National agencies often produce higher-resolution bathymetric models for their coastal waters, integrating various survey data.
NOAA NCEI Coastal Digital Elevation Models (DEMs):


Dataset: A suite of high-resolution coastal DEMs developed by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), including the Continuously Updated Digital Elevation Models (CUDEM).34
Source/Provider: NOAA NCEI. These DEMs integrate bathymetric and topographic data from diverse sources, including the NOAA Office of Coast Survey (OCS), National Geodetic Survey (NGS), Office for Coastal Management (OCM), USGS, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), academic institutions, and private companies.34
Data Type: Primarily integrated bathymetric-topographic raster DEMs for the highest resolution products (e.g., 1/9 arc-second), while coarser resolutions may map bathymetry only.34
Coverage/Resolution: Coverage focuses on the coastal regions of the United States, including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and other territories.35 The DEMs employ a "telescoping" resolution approach, with the highest resolution (e.g., 1/9 arc-second, ~3 meters) near the coast, transitioning to coarser resolutions (e.g., 1/3 arc-second ~10m, 1 arc-second ~30m, up to 1 arc-minute) further offshore.34
Access: Data is accessible through various NOAA portals, including the NCEI Bathymetry Data Viewer/Map 34, the NCEI THREDDS Data Server 35, direct file download (HTTPS) 38, and cloud access via AWS S3.38 Available formats typically include NetCDF and GeoTiff.37
Licensing: As products of the U.S. federal government (NOAA), these DEMs are considered U.S. Government Works and are not subject to copyright protection within the United States.37 Access is free.39 Standard NOAA disclaimers regarding data accuracy and use liability apply.37
Relevance: NOAA's coastal DEMs provide authoritative, high-resolution, integrated elevation data crucial for detailed modeling and analysis in US coastal zones. Applications include tsunami inundation modeling, storm surge prediction, sea-level rise impact assessment, coastal habitat mapping, marine spatial planning, and hazard mitigation.34 The "continuously updated" nature implies ongoing improvements as new survey data becomes available.35
NOAA NCEI ETOPO Global Relief Model:


Dataset: ETOPO Global Relief Model. The current version is ETOPO 2022.40
Source/Provider: NOAA NCEI.
Data Type: Global relief model integrating land topography and ocean bathymetry.40 Available in two main versions: "Ice Surface" (representing the top of ice sheets) and "Bedrock" (representing the land surface beneath ice sheets).40
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage.40 Available at multiple grid resolutions: 15 arc-seconds, 30 arc-seconds, and 60 arc-seconds.40 The older ETOPO1 version had a 1 arc-minute resolution.41
Access: Data can be downloaded directly from the NCEI website.40 Available formats include GeoTiff and NetCDF.40
Licensing: While not explicitly stated for ETOPO 2022 in the snippets, consistency with other NCEI products like CUDEM 37 suggests it is likely a U.S. Government Work and in the public domain or under a similar open access policy. Access is free. Documentation, including a user guide and metadata, is available.40
Relevance: ETOPO provides another comprehensive global relief model option, developed independently from GEBCO and potentially incorporating different source datasets or interpolation methods. It is suitable for global visualization, ocean circulation modeling, and providing topographic/bathymetric context. Comparing ETOPO and GEBCO might be beneficial depending on the specific requirements of an application.
Implications for A2A World
The availability of global bathymetry data is well-established, with GEBCO serving as the widely accepted international standard.20 Its explicit public domain status provides maximum flexibility for integration and reuse within the A2A World Nexus, offering a reliable and legally unencumbered foundational layer for representing the ~70% of the Earth's surface covered by oceans.20
Similar to terrestrial elevation data, however, a significant disparity exists between the resolution of global bathymetric models (~15 arc-second or ~450m for GEBCO) and the high-resolution data available for specific coastal regions, typically generated through national mapping programs.20 The NOAA NCEI coastal DEMs for the US, with resolutions down to 1/9 arc-second (~3m), exemplify this richness of data in well-surveyed national waters.35 This highlights that while the Nexus will have excellent global baseline bathymetry via GEBCO, achieving high detail in coastal zones worldwide will require identifying, accessing, and integrating data from various other national hydrographic offices or regional mapping initiatives, mirroring the challenge faced with terrestrial geology and high-resolution DEMs. The "continuously updated" nature of NOAA's CUDEM program is advantageous for US coasts but underscores the dynamic nature of coastal bathymetry and the need for ongoing data acquisition efforts globally.35
7. Atmospheric and Climate Data
Understanding atmospheric conditions and climate patterns, both past and present, is fundamental to modeling Earth systems. Relevant data includes direct observations from weather stations, globally complete gridded reanalysis products that assimilate observations into a model framework, and reconstructions of historical and paleoclimate conditions.
7.1 Observational Station Data
These datasets provide direct measurements from instruments located at specific points on the Earth's surface.
NOAA NCEI Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-D):


Dataset: GHCN-Daily Version 3 integrates daily climate observations from numerous sources.42

Licensing: Data is freely available.52 Users are required to cite the main PaleoClim publication and potentially the original sources for the underlying GCM data.52 The rpaleoclim package itself is under an MIT license.53
Relevance: PaleoClim provides essential data for reconstructing past environmental conditions and understanding long-term climate dynamics beyond the instrumental record. This deep-time perspective is valuable for the A2A World initiative to contextualize modern changes and model long-term processes.
Implications for A2A World
The atmospheric and climate data domain offers a rich mix of observational records and modeled products. A key strength lies in the complementary nature of station observations (like GHCN-D and GHCN-H) and gridded reanalysis (like ERA5). While station data provides invaluable ground truth measurements at specific locations, its spatial coverage is inherently sparse and uneven.42 Reanalysis products, conversely, offer complete global, gridded coverage by assimilating diverse observations into a physically consistent model framework, but they remain model estimates.11 The A2A World Nexus should incorporate both types: station data for point validation, local trend analysis, and ground-truthing, and reanalysis for spatially continuous fields required for large-scale modeling, climate analysis, and driving other environmental models.
The availability of datasets spanning different time periods provides crucial temporal context. Modern observations (GHCN) and reanalysis (ERA5) capture recent decades in detail.11 Historical averages like WorldClim (1970-2000) offer a widely used baseline for the late 20th century 51, while paleoclimate reconstructions like PaleoClim extend the view back thousands or millions of years.52 Integrating these datasets allows the Nexus to support analyses across multiple timescales, from diurnal weather patterns to millennial-scale climate shifts, providing a much richer understanding of Earth system variability and change.
Accessibility is generally good, with major datasets like ERA5 and GHCN available through multiple channels, including agency portals (NCEI, Copernicus CDS), cloud platforms (GCS), APIs, and specialized software packages (R packages for WorldClim/PaleoClim).11 This flexibility in access methods and data formats (ASCII, NetCDF, GRIB, Zarr) facilitates integration into the diverse technical workflows anticipated within the A2A World Nexus, supporting cloud computing, desktop GIS, and programmatic analysis approaches.11
8. Geophysical Data
Geophysical datasets, particularly those describing Earth's magnetic and gravity fields, provide crucial information about the planet's interior structure and dynamics, and are essential for applications ranging from navigation and geodesy to resource exploration and understanding plate tectonics.
8.1 Earth's Magnetic Field
Data describing the geomagnetic field includes global models representing the long-term field generated by the Earth's core, and high-frequency measurements from ground observatories capturing shorter-term variations.
World Magnetic Model (WMM):


Dataset: The World Magnetic Model (WMM), updated every five years. The current version is WMM2025.54
Source/Provider: Produced jointly by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the British Geological Survey (BGS) on behalf of the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD).54
Data Type: A mathematical (spherical harmonic) model representing Earth's main magnetic field (generated by the core) and its slow secular variation (annual change).54 The model is typically resolved to degree and order 12.55
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage. The WMM2025 model is valid for the period 2025.0 to 2030.0.54 It provides values for the seven magnetic field components (e.g., Declination, Inclination, Total Intensity) and their annual rates of change.54
Access: Distributed by NOAA NCEI via their website.54 Access methods include: the model coefficients file (WMM.COF), C source code for calculating field values, official software with graphical interfaces for Windows and Linux, standalone online calculators (for single points, grids, or declination lookup), and mobile applications (e.g., CrowdMag).54
Licensing: The WMM source code and associated information are explicitly stated to be in the U.S. Public Domain, not licensed or under copyright, and may be used freely by the public.54
Relevance: WMM is the standard model used globally for navigation systems that rely on the geomagnetic field, particularly for correcting compass readings (magnetic declination) and for attitude and heading reference systems.54 Its integration is essential for applications requiring accurate orientation relative to magnetic north.
INTERMAGNET Observatory Data:


Dataset: Time series data from the global network of INTERMAGNET magnetic observatories.
Source/Provider: Data is collected by individual scientific institutes operating the observatories worldwide. INTERMAGNET coordinates standards and facilitates data exchange.56
Data Type: High-resolution time series measurements of the Earth's magnetic field components (e.g., X, Y, Z or H, D, Z).54 Data is typically available at one-minute resolution, sometimes one-second or hourly. Data is categorized as definitive (final quality-controlled) or quasi-definitive/preliminary (near real-time).56
Coverage/Resolution: Coverage consists of a network of approximately 100-150 participating observatories distributed globally, though the distribution is uneven.56 Temporal resolution is high (typically 1-minute). Definitive data is available historically from 1991 onwards, with DOIs assigned since 2013.56
Access: Data is primarily accessed via the INTERMAGNET data portal.56 Data may also be available from World Data Centres for Geomagnetism or directly from the operating institutes.56
Licensing: The default license for data downloaded via INTERMAGNET is the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).56 This permits free use for non-commercial purposes, requiring attribution. Commercial use, sale, or bulk redistribution requires written permission from the specific institute operating the observatory.56 Some institutes may have different or additional license conditions.56 Proper acknowledgement of the data source (observatory, institute, INTERMAGNET) is required.56
Relevance: INTERMAGNET data provides high-accuracy, high-temporal-resolution ground truth measurements of the Earth's magnetic field and its variations. It is essential for calibrating and validating global models like WMM, studying rapid geomagnetic variations (e.g., magnetic storms caused by space weather), and understanding regional magnetic field behaviour.
8.2 Gravity Field Models
Gravity field models describe variations in Earth's gravitational acceleration, reflecting mass distribution within the planet. They are crucial for geodesy, particularly for determining the geoid (the equipotential surface approximating mean sea level).
Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008):
Dataset: Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008).
Source/Provider: Developed and released by the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) EGM Development Team.58
Data Type: A spherical harmonic model representing the Earth's external gravitational potential.58
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage. The model is complete to spherical harmonic degree and order 2159, with additional coefficients extending to degree 2190.58 This high degree corresponds to fine spatial detail. Derived products like geoid height grids are often provided at resolutions such as 1x1 arc-minute, 2.5x2.5 arc-minute, or 5x5 arc-minute.59
Access: The model is publicly released by NGA and accessible via the NGA Earth-info website.59 It is also mirrored or used by other organizations like the Bureau Gravimétrique International (BGI) 59 (though their site may be down 59) and incorporated into various geodetic software and tools (e.g., GeographicLib utilities 58, Hydromagic EGM2008 utility 60). Data is available both as the raw spherical harmonic coefficients and as pre-computed grids of derived quantities like geoid undulation (height difference between the reference ellipsoid and the geoid) or gravity anomalies.58
Licensing: EGM2008 was publicly released by NGA.59 As a product of a US government agency, it is strongly presumed to be in the U.S. Public Domain or available under a similarly open license permitting free use. However, an explicit license statement was not found in the reviewed snippets.61 Confirmation should ideally be sought from the NGA source, but widespread use in open tools suggests minimal restrictions.
Relevance: EGM2008 is the standard high-resolution global gravity model. Its primary importance lies in defining the geoid with high accuracy, which is essential for converting ellipsoidal heights obtained from GPS/GNSS systems into physically meaningful orthometric heights (heights above mean sea level).60 It is fundamental for geodesy, surveying, mapping, oceanography (determining sea surface topography), and geophysical studies of Earth's structure.
Implications for A2A World
The geophysical data domain features a pattern similar to climate data, with standard global models providing comprehensive coverage complemented by sparser, high-accuracy ground-based observations. Global models like WMM for the magnetic field 54 and EGM2008 for the gravity field 58 offer consistent representations essential for global applications like navigation and geoid determination. Ground observations, such as those from the INTERMAGNET network 56, provide crucial high-fidelity data for validating these models and studying localized or rapid temporal variations. The A2A World Nexus should ideally incorporate both: the global models for baseline consistency and the observational networks for ground truth and detailed studies.
Licensing within this domain shows notable variation, underscoring the need for careful tracking. The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is clearly in the U.S. Public Domain, offering maximum flexibility.54 In contrast, INTERMAGNET data defaults to a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) license, which restricts commercial applications without explicit permission from the data-providing institute.56 The EGM2008 model, while publicly released by NGA 59 and widely used, lacks an explicit license statement in the reviewed materials, although its US government origin strongly suggests it is likely public domain or has very open terms. This variability highlights that even within a single thematic domain like geophysics, license terms can differ significantly, impacting how data can be integrated and utilized within the A2A World Nexus. The non-commercial clause associated with INTERMAGNET data, for instance, could pose limitations depending on the intended applications and user base of the Nexus.
9. Land Cover, Population, and Basemap Data
Beyond fundamental Earth observation and physical field data, thematic layers describing land cover, human population distribution, and cartographic base features (like administrative boundaries, roads, water bodies) are critical for a wide range of environmental, socioeconomic, and planning applications within the A2A World framework.

Licensing: Distributed under the standard Copernicus free and open data policy, requiring attribution to the "European Union's Copernicus Land Monitoring Service".5
Relevance: Provides a consistent annual time series of global land cover at 100m resolution for the 2015-2019 period, valuable for analyzing recent land cover dynamics and changes prior to the 10m WorldCover product.
MODIS Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1):


Dataset: MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type Yearly L3 Global 500m SIN Grid product (MCD12Q1), Collection 6/6.1.67 Contains multiple land cover classification schemes (e.g., IGBP, UMD).67
Source/Provider: NASA, with algorithm development often led by institutions like Boston University.67
Data Type: Raster global land cover maps.67
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage at 500-meter spatial resolution.67 Produced annually from 2001 to present (e.g., 2001-2022 used in analysis 69).67
Access: Distributed by NASA's Land Processes DAAC (LP DAAC) 67 and Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive & Distribution System (LAADS) DAAC.68 Data is typically in HDF-EOS format.
Licensing: As a standard NASA product, it is freely accessible and likely governed by public domain or similar open data policies typical for NASA EOSDIS data. Citation of the dataset and associated publications is requested.68
Relevance: Despite its coarser resolution compared to recent products, MCD12Q1 offers the longest consistent time series (2001-present) among these global land cover datasets, making it indispensable for historical analysis and understanding land cover trends over the past two decades.69
9.2 Human Settlement & Population
These datasets map the location and density of human populations and built infrastructure.
Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL):


Dataset: A suite of products including GHS-BUILT (mapping built-up surfaces/volumes/heights), GHS-POP (gridded population counts/density), and GHS-SMOD (settlement model classifying urban/rural areas).70
Source/Provider: European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC).70
Data Type: Gridded raster datasets derived from satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) and integrated with census data.70
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage.70 Available for multiple epochs, typically 1975, 1990, 2000, 2015, with projections/updates to 2020, 2025, 2030.70 Spatial resolution varies by product: GHS-BUILT-S is available at 10m and 100m; GHS-POP is often provided at 250m or 1km resolution.70
Access: Data is downloadable from the JRC Data Catalogue and the GHSL project website.70 Options include downloading global files or tiles, typically in GeoTIFF format.72
Licensing: Distributed under the standard free and open access policy of the European Commission/JRC. Requires citation.
Relevance: GHSL provides a globally consistent, multi-temporal dataset on human presence, mapping both the physical extent of settlements and the distribution of population based on integrating remote sensing and census information. It is vital for understanding urbanization trends, exposure assessment, and sustainable development monitoring.70
Gridded Population of the World (GPW) v4:


Dataset: Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (currently v4.11). Includes population counts, population density, UN-adjusted counts and density, land/water area, and data quality indicators.73
Source/Provider: NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) at the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), Columbia University.73
Data Type: Gridded raster datasets representing population distribution.73
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage.73 Population estimates are provided for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020.73 The native spatial resolution is 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km at the equator), with aggregated versions available at coarser resolutions (2.5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 degree).73
Access: Data is available for download from the NASA SEDAC website.73 Formats include GeoTIFF, ASCII, and NetCDF. A web-based Population Estimation Service (PES) allows users to query population estimates for user-defined areas.75
Licensing: Data is openly available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.75
Relevance: GPWv4 is a widely used baseline global population dataset. Its methodology focuses on disaggregating census data based on administrative boundaries with minimal modeling, aiming to maintain fidelity to the input census counts and spatial units.73 This provides an alternative approach to GHSL-POP and is valuable for analyses where assumptions about population distribution relative to built-up areas might be problematic.
9.3 Vector Basemaps
Vector datasets provide discrete geographic features like boundaries, roads, rivers, points of interest, essential for cartographic context and network analysis.
Natural Earth:


Dataset: A collection of integrated vector (and raster) datasets designed for cartography, available in cultural (e.g., boundaries, populated places) and physical (e.g., coastlines, rivers, lakes) themes.76
Source/Provider: A collaborative project supported by the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS), hosted at naturalearthdata.com.76
Data Type: Vector data (points, lines, polygons) with attributes optimized for mapmaking (e.g., feature names, importance ranking).76
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage. Data is carefully generalized and provided at three distinct scales: 1:10 million, 1:50 million, and 1:110 million, ensuring cartographic consistency at each scale.76
Access: Data is downloadable directly from the Natural Earth website 76, typically as shapefiles.
Licensing: All Natural Earth data is explicitly dedicated to the Public Domain. It is free for any use (personal, educational, commercial) without permission, and attribution is optional (though appreciated).76
Relevance: Natural Earth is an invaluable resource for creating visually pleasing and cartographically sound basemaps at small to medium scales. Its public domain status and scale-specific generalizations make it extremely easy to integrate and use.
OpenStreetMap (OSM):


Dataset: A global database of geographic features contributed and maintained by a volunteer community. The full dataset is known as "Planet.osm".78
Source/Provider: The OpenStreetMap community, managed by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).79
Data Type: Vector data consisting of nodes (points), ways (lines or polygons), and relations, described by user-defined key-value pairs known as tags (a folksonomy).79 Covers a vast range of features including roads, buildings, points of interest (POIs), land use, water bodies, administrative boundaries, etc.
Coverage/Resolution: Global coverage. The level of detail and accuracy varies significantly depending on the extent of contributor activity in a given area.79 Some urban areas have extremely high detail, while remote areas may be sparse.
Access: The full Planet.osm file (in XML or PBF format) is released weekly and can be downloaded via the OSM website, various mirrors, or BitTorrent.78 Due to its large size (~100GB+ for PBF), users often work with regional or country-level extracts provided by third parties (e.g., Geofabrik).78 Various APIs and web services also provide access to live or processed OSM data.
Licensing: The OpenStreetMap database is licensed under the Open Database License (ODbL) version 1.0.79 This license allows users to freely copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt the data, but requires attribution to OpenStreetMap contributors. Crucially, if a user creates a derivative database using OSM data, that derivative database must also be licensed under the ODbL (ShareAlike condition).79 Produced maps (cartographic outputs) require attribution but are not necessarily bound by the ShareAlike clause.79 Access to the data itself is free.78
Relevance: OpenStreetMap provides an unparalleled source of detailed, up-to-date, and globally extensive vector basemap information, constantly being improved by its community. It is indispensable for applications requiring detailed road networks, building footprints, points of interest, or fine-grained land use information. However, its ODbL license requires careful management and compliance, especially regarding the ShareAlike provision for derivative databases, which could impact how OSM data is integrated and combined with other datasets within the A2A World Nexus.
Implications for A2A World
The domain of land cover mapping has seen rapid advancements, exemplified by the emergence of 10-meter resolution global products like ESA WorldCover, driven largely by the capabilities of the Sentinel satellite constellation.12 This represents a significant leap in detail compared to previous standards like the 100m Copernicus Global Land Service products or the 500m MODIS MCD12Q1.65 The A2A World Nexus can thus leverage state-of-the-art land cover information for highly detailed analyses. However, this higher resolution comes with a shorter time series; for historical context predating ~2015-2020, coarser products like CGLS-LC100 or the long-running MODIS MCD12Q1 remain essential.65 Furthermore, analysts must be mindful of potential inconsistencies when comparing maps from different years or products, especially if underlying algorithms have changed (as noted between WorldCover 2020 and 2021 64).
In mapping human population, distinct methodological approaches offer different perspectives. Datasets like the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) integrate information on built-up areas derived from satellite imagery to inform the spatial disaggregation of census population counts.70 In contrast, the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) aims for minimal modeling, primarily distributing census counts across administrative units to maintain fidelity to the original census geography.73 Including both GHSL-POP and GPWv4 within the A2A World Nexus would provide users with valuable flexibility, allowing them to select the dataset whose underlying assumptions best fit their specific analysis or to compare results derived from these different population distribution philosophies.
For vector basemaps, a clear choice exists between the simplicity and permissive licensing of Natural Earth and the unparalleled detail but more complex licensing of OpenStreetMap. Natural Earth, being in the public domain, is ideal for creating generalized cartographic context at smaller scales without licensing concerns.76 OpenStreetMap offers vastly more detail suitable for large-scale mapping, routing, and detailed spatial analysis, but its Open Database License (ODbL) requires careful adherence, particularly the ShareAlike clause which mandates that databases derived from OSM must also be shared under ODbL.79 The integration strategy for OSM within the A2A World Nexus must account for these licensing obligations to ensure compliance.

11. Evaluation of the Geospatial Data Landscape for A2A World
Synthesizing the findings from the inventory of specific datasets allows for a broader assessment of the geospatial data landscape as it pertains to the A2A World Planetary Data Nexus initiative. This evaluation considers overall data availability and accessibility, the critical dimension of licensing, identified gaps and challenges, and provides recommendations for data acquisition and integration within the Nexus framework. The findings presented aim to inform the data acquisition strategy and technical architecture design for the A2A World project.
11.1 Overall Availability and Accessibility Assessment
The current landscape offers a remarkable abundance of high-quality geospatial data relevant to A2A World, particularly in certain core domains. Global, systematically acquired satellite imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel constellation (Sentinel-1, -2) 2 and the USGS/NASA Landsat program 7 is readily available, providing frequent, multi-sensor coverage essential for monitoring Earth's surface. Similarly, standard global models for bathymetry (GEBCO) 20, atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) 11, gravity (EGM2008) 59, magnetic fields (WMM) 54, and population distribution (GHSL, GPWv4) 70 provide comprehensive baseline datasets.
Accessibility has dramatically improved through the establishment of dedicated data portals (e.g., Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem 3, USGS EarthExplorer 8, NOAA NCEI hubs 42) and the increasing availability of data directly on major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud).7 This shift towards cloud hosting, often coupled with the provision of data in Analysis-Ready Data (ARD) formats like Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) 2 or Zarr 11, significantly lowers the barrier for users, reducing the need for extensive local downloads and pre-processing. This trend strongly favors the development of cloud-native analysis capabilities within the A2A World Nexus.
However, this general abundance contrasts with areas where data availability or accessibility remains challenging. Globally consistent, high-resolution terrain data (equivalent to US 3DEP LiDAR) 13 is largely absent from the public domain. Comprehensive, standardized global geological map coverage is difficult to achieve due to the fragmented, national nature of
