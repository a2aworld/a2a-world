## 🎨 Inspiration & Creativity

### The Inspiration Engine

Terra Constellata includes a unique AI system that detects novelty and generates creative inspiration. Think of it as a "creativity amplifier" for your research.

#### How It Works:
1. **Novelty Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in your data
2. **Context Analysis**: Understands the domain and cultural context
3. **Creative Generation**: Produces novel ideas and research directions
4. **Inspiration Ranking**: Rates ideas by creative potential

### Using the Inspiration Engine

#### Method 1: Automatic Analysis
Upload your data and let the system find novel patterns:

```python
# The system automatically analyzes your data for inspiration
# Look for the "💡 Inspiration" tab in the React app
```

#### Method 2: Targeted Inspiration
Ask specific questions:

> "What novel connections can you find between these cultural sites and mythological stories?"

> "Generate creative research questions about ancient trade routes."

#### Method 3: Creative Prompts
Get AI-generated prompts for your research:

```python
# Request creative prompts
prompts = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/inspiration/prompts", json={
    "domain": "mythology",
    "num_prompts": 5,
    "creativity_level": "high"
})

for prompt in prompts.json():
    print(f"💡 {prompt['content']}")
    print(f"   Potential: {prompt['creative_potential']}/10")
```

### Inspiration Examples

#### For Mythology Research:
- "What if ancient flood myths were actually describing astronomical events?"
- "Could mountain ranges have inspired the concept of 'world pillars' in creation myths?"
- "Are there linguistic connections between words for 'sacred' across cultures?"

#### For Geography Research:
- "What patterns emerge when you overlay trade routes with mythological sites?"
- "Could climate patterns have influenced the locations of sacred sites?"
- "Are there geometric patterns in the placement of ancient monuments?"

### Managing Inspiration

#### Saving Good Ideas:
1. **Bookmark Prompts**: Save interesting ideas for later
2. **Create Research Notes**: Link inspiration to your data
3. **Track Development**: See how ideas evolve over time
4. **Share with Team**: Collaborate on creative insights

#### Inspiration History:
- **View Past Ideas**: See what inspired you before
- **Track Impact**: Which ideas led to breakthroughs?
- **Learn Patterns**: Understand what types of data spark creativity
